Essential question: Is the game fair?

Some games of skill address skill gaps with handicapping
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapping

Mario Kart addresses skill gaps this with difficulty level ([50cc/100cc/150cc](http://mariokartwii.wikia.com/wiki/CC)), [item distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FU5OJxj75c&feature=youtu.be&t=148), and dynamic game difficulty balancing.

## Probability
Independent Probability - Die Rolls / Coin Flips
Khan Academy - Intro to theoretical probability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk

Khan Academy - Theoretical and experimental probability: Coin flips and die rolls
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/randomness-probability-simulation/a/theoretical-and-experimental-probability-coin-flips-and-die-rolls

1 coin = 2 equally likely possibilities
2 coins = 4 equally likely possibilities
3 coins = 8 equally likely possibilities

- With one die (aka 1d6), what is the prob. of rolling 1?
- With two coins (2d2), what is the prob. of flipping heads & heads?
- With two dice (2d6), what is the prob. of rolling doubles?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 12?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 6?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 1?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 7?
- With six coins (6d2), what is the prob. of flipping 1 heads & 5 tails?

Dependent Probability - Card Draws
Khan Academy - Dependent probability introduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjLEoo3hIoM
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 Aces?
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 hearts?
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 face cards (J, Q, or K)?

### Problems with Probability
The Monty Hall Problem - Human Perception can be skewed
Monty Hall Problem - Numberphile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0

Try to predict the probability for ANY 1-12 on two dice (for example, rolling a 1 and a 2 counts as rolling 1, 2, AND 3)
