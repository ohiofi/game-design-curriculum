## Probability

### Independent Probability - Die Rolls / Coin Flips
Khan Academy - Intro to theoretical probability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk

Khan Academy - Theoretical and experimental probability: Coin flips and die rolls
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/randomness-probability-simulation/a/theoretical-and-experimental-probability-coin-flips-and-die-rolls

1 coin = 2 equally likely possibilities
2 coins = 4 equally likely possibilities
3 coins = 8 equally likely possibilities

- With one die (aka 1d6), what is the prob. of rolling 1?
- With two coins (2d2), what is the prob. of flipping heads & heads?
- With two dice (2d6), what is the prob. of rolling doubles?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 12?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 6?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 1?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 7?
- With six coins (6d2), what is the prob. of flipping 1 heads & 5 tails?

### Dependent Probability - Card Draws
Khan Academy - Dependent probability introduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjLEoo3hIoM
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 Aces?
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 hearts?
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 face cards (J, Q, or K)?

### Problems with Probability
Humans are not always rational

The Monty Hall Problem - Human Perception can be skewed
Monty Hall Problem - Numberphile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0

Try to predict the probability for ANY 1-12 on two dice (for example, rolling a 1 and a 2 counts as rolling 1, 2, AND 3)

### Pseudo-Random number generation on computers

Liar's Dice - Probability mixed with Bluffing (see also: Poker)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRI_Yvze2ms

### Game Theory: Psychology + Games

- The Risk Game - I will give you 50 points now or we can flip a coin and you get 0/100 points
- Loss Aversion Game - We flip a coin and you get -50/100 points. Play or not?
- The Ultimatum Game - 2 players, p1 gets 100 points to split, p2 gets to accept or decline
- Split or Steal - Both split 200, one steals 200, or both steal nothing
- Press Your Luck - I will give you 100 points for each heads, but you bust on tails
- The Risk Game - I will give you 40 points now or we can flip a coin and you get 0/100 points
- Loss Aversion Game - We flip a coin and you get -100/100 points. Play or not?

### Discuss: What are some games with multiple victory conditions?
Multiple Paths to Victory
https://lanepushinggames.com/article/killer-queen-thoughts-on-multiple-victory-conditions

Multiple victory or loss conditions. For example, a round of Pokémon Trading Card Game can end in three ways:
- When one player has Knocked Out enough of the other's Pokémon to draw all his Prize Cards
- When one player is unable to play a Pokémon from his Bench to replace his Active Pokémon
- When one player has run out of cards in his Deck and is unable to draw at the beginning of his turn.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics#Combination_conditions

FPS Level Design - "...it is always advantageous for the player to have a number of paths to get to and from every major area in a multiplayer map."
https://www.ongamedesign.net/designing-fps-multiplayer-maps-part-1/

Agency (sociology) - the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)

Player Agency: How Game Design Affects Narrative
https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshBycer/20150126/234961/Player_Agency_How_Game_Design_Affects_Narrative.php

### Asymmetric Win Conditions
Common styles of asymmetric games:
- social deduction games (hidden loyalty games) such as Werewolf, The Resistance, Two Rooms and a Boom, or Battlestar Galactica. In these games, asymmetry is critical because it facilitates deduction of a player's hidden allegiance based on how they act.
- chase games, such as Scotland Yard, Mr. Jack, Fury of Dracula, or freeze tag. In these games, the primary game activity is inherently asymmetric.
- one-versus-many games, such as Descent, Dead of Winter, or Mansions of Madness (first edition), which I suspect are mostly offshoots of tabletop RPGs (such as D&D) and so have inherited the concept of an "adventuring party". You could also look at these as cooperative games where the "game system" has been expanded into an actual player role. Ultimately, I think this model derives from traditional storytelling--their asymmetry results from the fact that one side is "protagonists" and the other is "antagonists".
Source: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/27705805#27705805

BANG! is also asymmetric:
- Sheriff and Deputies: Win if all outlaws and renegade dead, sheriff still alive.
- Outlaws: Win if Sheriff dead.
- Renegade: All players dead but himself. The game ends when the sheriff dies, so the renegade only wins if he kills the sheriff last.
