#### Toys vs games vs puzzles vs simulations

**READ**: My Definition of 'Game' by Chris Crawford
[http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/jcgd-volume-4/my-definition-of-game.html](http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/jcgd-volume-4/my-definition-of-game.html)

Chris Crawford is a veteran game designer and founder of the Game Developers Conference (GDC). He's written several book on game design and his 1984 book [The Art of Computer Game Design](https://www.digitpress.com/library/books/book_art_of_computer_game_design.pdf) is  available online. Crawford's hierarchy/taxonomy of games divides interactive entertainment ("intertainments") into 5 categories: Interactive Stories, Toys, Puzzles, Competitions, and Games.

Which category do the following describe?
- challenges without opponents that have clearly defined goals
- interactive playthings, simulations, and sandbox games without defined goals
- challenges with opponents without direct interaction between the competitors
- narratives with limited interaction in which the primary entertainment value is the storyline
- challenges with opponents in which the players (human or A.I.) directly interact in such a way as to foil each other’s goals

Not enough luck could lead to:
- Solved Games
- Being out of your league / swimming out of your depth

#### Being out of your league / swimming out of your depth

Imagine playing chess against a Grand Master. Imagine boxing Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather. Imagine serving as goalkeeper against Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. You would likely be so out-matched that it would not be a very fun game.

## Game Balance

Left 4 Dead has a AI Director system "...which dynamically adjusts the game’s dramatics and pacing along with the difficulty. For example, spawning enemies are appropriately placed and numbered based on the player's current situation." [Source](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2012/625476/)

"...in Max Payne the game dynamically adjusts the strength of enemies and can also provide different levels of aiming assistance for players" [Source](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2012/625476/)

## Probability

### Independent Probability - Die Rolls / Coin Flips

2 coins = 4 equally likely possibilities
3 coins = 8 equally likely possibilities

- With two coins (2d2), what is the prob. of flipping heads & heads?
- With two dice (2d6), what is the prob. of rolling doubles?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 12?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 6?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 1?
- With two dice, what is the prob. of rolling 7?
- With six coins (6d2), what is the prob. of flipping 1 heads & 5 tails?

### Dependent Probability - Card Draws

- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 hearts?
- With a 52-card deck, what is the prob. of drawing 2 face cards (J, Q, or K)?

### Problems with Probability
Humans are not always rational

The Monty Hall Problem - Human Perception can be skewed
Monty Hall Problem - Numberphile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lb-6rxZxx0

Try to predict the probability for ANY 1-12 on two dice (for example, rolling a 1 and a 2 counts as rolling 1, 2, AND 3)

### Game Theory: Psychology + Games

- The Risk Game - I will give you 50 points now or we can flip a coin and you get 0/100 points
- Loss Aversion Game - We flip a coin and you get -50/100 points. Play or not?
- The Ultimatum Game - 2 players, p1 gets 100 points to split, p2 gets to accept or decline
- Split or Steal - Both split 200, one steals 200, or both steal nothing
- Press Your Luck - I will give you 100 points for each heads, but you bust on tails
- The Risk Game - I will give you 40 points now or we can flip a coin and you get 0/100 points
- Loss Aversion Game - We flip a coin and you get -100/100 points. Play or not?

### Discuss: What are some games with multiple victory conditions?
Multiple Paths to Victory
https://lanepushinggames.com/article/killer-queen-thoughts-on-multiple-victory-conditions

Multiple victory or loss conditions. For example, a round of Pokémon Trading Card Game can end in three ways:
- When one player has Knocked Out enough of the other's Pokémon to draw all his Prize Cards
- When one player is unable to play a Pokémon from his Bench to replace his Active Pokémon
- When one player has run out of cards in his Deck and is unable to draw at the beginning of his turn.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics#Combination_conditions

Games are finite state machines. There are a set number of game states. The game is not infinite. A finite state machine is hardware or software that moves through a series of modes and can only be in one mode at a time.

Discuss: Give me an example of a finite state machine (hardware device or software) and describe a few of its states.

### Player Agency

FPS Level Design - "...it is always advantageous for the player to have a number of paths to get to and from every major area in a multiplayer map."

Agency (sociology) - the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices

## Rule Symmetry/Asymmetry

Rule Symmetry means that all players share the same goals, rules, victory conditions.

Rule Asymmetry means that some players have different goals, rules, victory conditions.

The rules are different for goalies compared to other hockey players, but this does not mean that ice hockey is an asymmetric game. Both teams share the same goals, rules, and victory conditions. It would only be asymmetric if one team were all-time offense and the other team all-time defense.

### Asymmetric Win Conditions
Common styles of asymmetric games:
- social deduction games (hidden loyalty games) such as Werewolf, The Resistance, Two Rooms and a Boom, Spyfall, Saboteur, A Fake Artist Goes to New York, or Battlestar Galactica. In these games, asymmetry is critical because it facilitates deduction of a player's hidden allegiance based on how they act.
- chase games, such as Scotland Yard, Mr. Jack, Fury of Dracula, or freeze tag. In these games, the primary game activity is inherently asymmetric.
- one-versus-many games, such as Betrayal at House on the Hill, Descent, Dead of Winter, or Mansions of Madness (first edition), which I suspect are mostly offshoots of tabletop RPGs (such as D&D) and so have inherited the concept of an "adventuring party". You could also look at these as cooperative games where the "game system" has been expanded into an actual player role. Ultimately, I think this model derives from traditional storytelling--their asymmetry results from the fact that one side is "protagonists" and the other is "antagonists".
Source: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/27705805#27705805

BANG! is also asymmetric:
- Sheriff and Deputies: Win if all outlaws and renegade dead, sheriff still alive.
- Outlaws: Win if Sheriff dead.
- Renegade: All players dead but himself. The game ends when the sheriff dies, so the renegade only wins if he kills the sheriff last.

## Narrative Writing / World Building
You should be able to say, "Everything I needed to know about the game, I learned from the first level." The player should be able to infer the basic moves of the game, the mood and feel of the game, the culture of the world, etc.

How to Create a Video Game World
– Determine the Scope of Your World
– Develop a Backstory for This World
– Create a Culture and a System of Order
– Create Items for Your World
– Draw Out the Layout of This World

In Medias Res - Latin for "into the middle of things." Beginning the story with action. For example, "Where's Papa going with that ax?" This is preferable when compared to a boring intro giving the entire backstory.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res

Exposition - From Latin, meaning "a showing forth." Introducing background info about events, settings, characters, etc to the audience/readers. In other words, backstory. For example, "A long time ago in a galaxy far away, far away…" Too much exposition is generally considered a bad thing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_(narrative)

Exposition is a two-edged sword. While it is extremely useful for establishing setting, plot, and characterization, too much exposition at once can bog down a story and slow the pace to a crawl. An exposition that is overly long or wordy is known as an Information Dump (or Info Dump for short) and is very difficult to do well. Source: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition

"Show, Don't Tell" - Advice that narrative writing should show actions, relationships, and feelings instead of just directly telling the reader what happened. Too much exposition is generally considered a bad thing.
